# Summary Report - Module Documentation

## Overview
The Summary Report (Unified Overview) aggregates high-level metrics from all other reports into a single dashboard view. It provides the "at-a-glance" status of the entire project.

---

## Purpose
- **Aggregate** results (Unit, E2E, Quality, Architecture, Dependencies).
- **Determine** overall project health.
- **Navigation**: Provide links to detailed reports.
- **Dashboard**: Display key visualizations from other reports.

---

## Components

### 1. Data Builder
**File**: `src/nikhil/nibandha/reporting/summary.py` (`SummaryDataBuilder`)
**Responsibility**: Read `assets/data/*.json` generated by other reporters and combine metrics.
**See**: [data_builder.md](./data_builder.md)

### 2. Visualization
**Note**: The Summary Report typically *reuses* existing visualizations (e.g., embedding the Unit Outcome pie chart) rather than generating new ones, though it may generate a "Health Score" badge.

### 3. Template
**File**: `src/nikhil/nibandha/reporting/templates/summary_report_template.md`
**Responsibility**: Render dashboard markdown.
**See**: [template.md](./template.md)
