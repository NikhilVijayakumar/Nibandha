## Nomenclature

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | A quantitative measure of the number of independent paths through code |
| **Complexity Score** | A numerical value indicating code complexity (higher = more complex) |
| **Max Complexity** | The threshold above which a function is considered too complex (default: 10) |
| **McCabe Complexity** | Another name for cyclomatic complexity, named after Thomas J. McCabe |
| **Cognitive Load** | The mental effort required to understand code logic |
| **Refactoring** | The process of restructuring code to reduce complexity without changing behavior |

## ⚙️ Configuration (Optional)

> [!NOTE]
> **Optional:** This report works without configuration, using default max complexity of 10.

To customize complexity threshold, add to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
select = ["C901"]  # Enable complexity checks

[tool.ruff.mccabe]
max-complexity = 15  # Default is 10, increase if needed
```

**Guidelines:**
- **10 or less**: Recommended (industry standard)
- **11-15**: Acceptable for complex business logic
- **16+**: High risk, difficult to test and maintain

## 🛠️ Action Items

- [ ] Refactor high-complexity functions into smaller helpers
- [ ] Apply Strategy or Command pattern to reduce `if/else` chains  
- [ ] Use early returns and guard clauses to reduce nesting depth
- [ ] Consider adjusting max-complexity threshold in pyproject.toml if needed
